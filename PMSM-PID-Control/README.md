# PMSM Control Using PID Controllers

This repository contains the implementation of **Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM)** control using **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers**. The project demonstrates how PID controllers can be applied to manage the speed, torque, and current of a PMSM for efficient and precise motor control.
