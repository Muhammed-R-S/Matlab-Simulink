## Development Workflow  

1. **Requirements Analysis**:  
   - Analyzed and documented functional and non-functional requirements.  
   - Created use cases and system-level specifications.  

2. **System Design**:  
   - Designed the system architecture using UML diagrams.  
   - Modeled the control logic and system behavior in Simulink.  

3. **Implementation**:  
   - Developed a detailed Simulink model with modular and reusable components.   

4. **Testing and Validation**:  
   - Conducted MIL testing using Simulink Test Manager.  
   - Generated detailed test reports to ensure compliance with requirements.  

5. **Code Generation**:  
   - Generated production-ready code using Embedded Coder.
